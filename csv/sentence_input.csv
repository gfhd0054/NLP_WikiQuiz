4,History,American Civil War,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War,"Slavery was a major cause of disunion.[26] Although there were opposing views even in the Union States,[27][28] most Northern soldiers were mostly indifferent on the subject of slavery,[29] while Confederates fought the war mainly to protect a Southern society of which slavery was an integral part.[30][31] From the anti-slavery perspective, the issue was primarily about whether the system of slavery was an anachronistic evil that was incompatible with republicanism. The strategy of the anti-slavery forces was containment?to stop the expansion and thus put slavery on a path to gradual extinction.[32] The slave-holding interests in the South denounced this strategy as infringing upon their Constitutional rights.[33] Southern whites believed that the emancipation of slaves would destroy the South's economy, due to the large amount of capital invested in slaves and fears of integrating the ex-slave black population.[34] In particular, Southerners feared a repeat of ""the horrors of Santo Domingo"", in which nearly all white people ? including men, women, children, and even many sympathetic to abolition ? were killed after the successful slave revolt in Haiti. Historian Thomas Fleming points to the historical phrase ""a disease in the public mind"" used by critics of this idea, and proposes it contributed to the segregation in the Jim Crow era following emancipation.[35] These fears were exacerbated by the ","From the anti-slavery perspective, the issue was primarily about whether the system of slavery was an anachronistic evil that was incompatible with republicanism.",anti-slavery,KeyTerm,anachronistic evil,KeyTerm,republicanism,KeyTerm,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.

It occurred after the Crisis of the Late Middle Ages and was associated with great social change. In addition to the standard periodization, proponents of a long Renaissance put its beginning in the 14th century and its end in the 17th century. The traditional view focuses more on the early modern aspects of the Renaissance and argues that it was a break from the past, but many historians today focus more on its medieval aspects and argue that it was an extension of the Middle Ages.",was a period in European history marking the transition from the Middle Ages to Modernity and covering the 15th and 16th centuries.,the Middle Ages,KeyTerm,Modernity,KeyTerm,15th and 16th century,Ages,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.
6,History,Renaissance,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance,"The intellectual basis of the Renaissance was its version of humanism, derived from the concept of Roman Humanitas and the rediscovery of classical Greek philosophy, such as that of Protagoras, who said that ""Man is the measure of all things."" This new thinking became manifest in art, architecture, politics, science and literature. Early examples were the development of perspective in oil painting and the recycled knowledge of how to make concrete. Although the invention of metal movable type sped the dissemination of ideas from the later 15th century, the changes of the Renaissance were not uniformly experienced across Europe: the first traces appear in Italy as early as the late 13th century, in particular with the writings of Dante and the paintings of Giotto.","The intellectual basis of the Renaissance was its version of humanism, derived from the concept of Roman Humanitas and the rediscovery of classical Greek philosophy, such as that of Protagoras, who said that ""Man is the measure of all things.""",humanism,KeyTerm,Reoman Humanitas,KeyTerm,classical Greek philosophy,KeyTerm,Protagoras,KeyTerm,"""Man is the measure of all things.""",Quote,.,.,.,.

In politics, the Renaissance contributed to the development of the customs and conventions of diplomacy, and in science to an increased reliance on observation and inductive reasoning. Although the Renaissance saw revolutions in many intellectual pursuits, as well as social and political upheaval, it is perhaps best known for its artistic developments and the contributions of such polymaths as Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, who inspired the term ""Renaissance man"".","In politics, the Renaissance contributed to the development of the customs and conventions of diplomacy, and in science to an increased reliance on observation and inductive reasoning.",customs and conventions of diplomacy,KeyTerm,inductive reasoning,KeyTerm,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.

These diseases include hay fever, food allergies, atopic dermatitis, allergic asthma, and anaphylaxis. Symptoms may include red eyes, an itchy rash, sneezing, a runny nose, shortness of breath, or swelling. Food intolerances and food poisoning are separate conditions. Common allergens include pollen and certain foods. Metals and other substances may also cause problems. Food, insect stings, and medications are common causes of severe reactions. Their development is due to both genetic and environmental factors. The underlying mechanism involves immunoglobulin E antibodies (IgE), part of the body's immune system, binding to an allergen and then to a receptor on mast cells or basophils where it triggers the release of inflammatory chemicals such as histamine. Diagnosis is typically based on a person's medical history. Further testing of the skin or blood may be useful in certain cases. Positive tests, however, may not mean there is a significant allergy to the substance in question.

In some cases the memory loss can extend back decades, while in others the person may lose only a few months of memory.

17,Astronomy,Black hole,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole,"A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing?no particles or even electromagnetic radiation such as light?can escape from it. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole. The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon. Although the event horizon has an enormous effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, it has no locally detectable features. In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light. Moreover, quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass.
